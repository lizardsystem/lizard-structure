:mod:`lizard_structure.views` provides base views for each of the core
concepts defined in :ref:`chapter-core`. The basic premise is that
lizard-structure only *shows* a data source's structure. There are no edit
actions, so no POST/PUT/DELETE: only GET.

For the Django API we use `Django REST framework
<http://django-rest-framework.org/>`_.

Every view has a doctring that can mostly be used as-is by the subclasses that
implement the actual functionality. The docstring is rendered by Django REST
framework in the html API interface, so the view's docstring is the most
important information your API user is going to see. The base views' docstring
must be really clear and concise!

You normally do not have to implement any ``.get()`` method on a view, that is
all taken care of. Every view tells you which methods you have to fill in to
get the base view working with your data.
