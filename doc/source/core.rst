Introducing the core Lizard concepts
####################################

There are four core concepts in Lizard's structure:

Application

    Lizard can connect to a lot of data sources; an application provides such
    a connection. So :ref:`application` more or less equals "data source".

Project

    Within an :ref:`application`, there will be one or more basic groups of
    data. Every group of data is what we call a :ref:`project`.

Layer

    Every :ref:`project` has multiple layers in some sort of
    structure. A :ref:`layer` is most often a map layer, but it doesn't have
    to be.

Feature

    A :ref:`layer` consists of features. A map layer might show water
    level measurement points: every one of those is a :ref:`feature`.
